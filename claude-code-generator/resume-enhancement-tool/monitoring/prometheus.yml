# Prometheus Configuration for Resume Enhancement Tool
#
# This configuration sets up basic metrics collection for the application.
# For production, you may want to add additional scrape targets, alerting rules,
# and integrate with Alertmanager.

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s      # How frequently to scrape targets
  evaluation_interval: 15s  # How frequently to evaluate rules

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'resume-tool-monitor'
    environment: 'production'

# Alertmanager configuration (optional - configure if you set up Alertmanager)

#           - alertmanager:9093

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
