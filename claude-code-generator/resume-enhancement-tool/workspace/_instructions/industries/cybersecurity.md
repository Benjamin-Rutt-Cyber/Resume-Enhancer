## Quantification Examples

**Instead of:** "Managed security monitoring"
**Write:** "Managed 24/7 security monitoring using Splunk SIEM, correlating 10M+ events daily and reducing false positive rate from 45% to 8%"

**Instead of:** "Conducted vulnerability assessments"
**Write:** "Conducted quarterly vulnerability assessments across 500+ assets using Tenable.io, identifying and remediating 95% of critical vulnerabilities within 48-hour SLA"

**Instead of:** "Handled security incidents"
**Write:** "Led incident response for 30+ security incidents, achieving average containment time of 25 minutes and zero data breaches in 2-year period"

**Instead of:** "Implemented security tools"
**Write:** "Implemented CrowdStrike EDR solution across 2,000+ endpoints, detecting and preventing 150+ malware infections and reducing malware dwell time from 90 days to 4 hours"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Certifications at Bottom** - Put them at top!
2. **No Metrics** - Security needs quantifiable improvements
3. **Missing Frameworks** - Always mention NIST, ISO, SOC 2, etc.
4. **Generic IT Experience** - Focus on security-specific work
5. **No Tool Specifics** - Name the SIEM, EDR, vulnerability scanners
6. **Ignoring Compliance** - Highlight SOC 2, PCI, HIPAA experience
7. **No Incident Response** - Show you can handle active threats
8. **Missing Automation** - Security automation is crucial
