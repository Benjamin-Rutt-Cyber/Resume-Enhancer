- ✓ Include links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio)
- ✓ Use consistent date format
- ✓ Keep to 1-2 pages

### Don'ts:
- ✗ Don't use tables (ATS issues)
- ✗ Don't include outdated tech (unless relevant)
- ✗ Don't use jargon without context
- ✗ Don't list soft skills without proof
- ✗ Don't include irrelevant experience
- ✗ Don't use pronouns (I, me, my)

## Action Verbs for IT

**Development:**
- Architected, Engineered, Developed, Implemented, Built

## Quantification Examples

**Instead of:** "Worked on improving application performance"
**Write:** "Optimized application performance by implementing Redis caching and database query optimization, reducing average response time from 1.2s to 180ms (85% improvement)"

**Instead of:** "Developed features for web application"
**Write:** "Engineered 15+ user-facing features using React and TypeScript, increasing user engagement by 40% and reducing bounce rate from 35% to 18%"

**Instead of:** "Managed cloud infrastructure"
**Write:** "Managed AWS cloud infrastructure for applications serving 2M+ users, achieving 99.95% uptime while reducing monthly costs by $15K through resource optimization"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skills Section Too Generic** - Be specific with versions and tools
2. **No Technical Context** - Always mention technologies used
3. **Missing Metrics** - Quantify impact wherever possible
4. **Outdated Technologies** - Focus on current, relevant tech
5. **No Projects/GitHub** - Especially for developers, showcase work
6. **Burying Technical Skills** - Put them near the top
7. **Using Buzzwords Without Proof** - Back up claims with examples
