### Page 1 Structure (MOST IMPORTANT)
```markdown
# Name
Contact Info (ONE LINE)

## Professional Summary
2-3 sentences highlighting leadership/expertise (50-70 words)

## Core Competencies/Key Skills
8-12 skills in categories (Technical, Leadership, Industry-Specific)

## Professional Experience

### Job 1 - Current/Most Recent Role (5-6 bullets)
- Detailed achievements with metrics
- Leadership responsibilities
- Key projects and outcomes

### Job 2 - Previous Role (4-5 bullets)
- Relevant achievements
- Progression/promotions

[Continue until page is filled - DO NOT split a job between pages]
```

### Page 2 Structure

```
[Full Name] | [Phone] | [Email] | Page 2
```

```markdown
[Continued from Page 1 if needed]

### Job 3 - Earlier Role (2-3 bullets)
- Condensed achievements
- Most relevant highlights only

### Job 4 - Older Role (1-2 bullets)
- Key accomplishments only

## Education
Degree, Institution, Year (no GPA unless exceptional)

## Certifications & Professional Development
List 4-8 relevant certifications with dates

## Optional Sections (if space permits)
- Publications
- Speaking Engagements
- Awards & Recognition
- Professional Affiliations
```

### 2-Page Best Practices

1. **Page Break Strategy:**
   - ✅ Finish complete job description on page 1
   - ✅ Start fresh job on page 2
   - ❌ NEVER split a single job between pages
   - ❌ NEVER end page 1 mid-bullet

2. **Content Distribution:**
   - **Page 1 = 60-70%** of total content weight
   - **Page 2 = 30-40%** supporting details
   - First page should standalone (recruiters read top half first)

3. **Visual Balance:**
   - Both pages should look full and professional
   - Don't cram page 1 and leave page 2 sparse
   - Balance white space between sections
   - Keep margins consistent across both pages

4. **Second Page Header:**
   - Include name, phone, email, "Page 2"
   - Ensures pages stay connected if separated
   - Use same font/style as page 1

### What to REDUCE on Page 2
- Older jobs get 2-3 bullets (vs 4-5 for recent)
- Education is condensed (degree + dates only)
- Remove jobs older than 15 years unless highly relevant

---

## Bullet Point Guidelines (ALL RESUMES)

### Quantity by Job Relevance

| Job Position | Bullet Points | Rationale |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Most Recent/Current** | 4-6 bullets | Highest relevance, detailed achievements |
| **2nd Most Recent** | 3-4 bullets | Still relevant, moderate detail |
| **Older Jobs (3-5 years ago)** | 2-3 bullets | Condensed highlights only |
| **Very Old Jobs (5+ years ago)** | 1-2 bullets OR remove | Only if highly relevant to target role |

### Quality Requirements

**Each Bullet Must:**
- ✅ Be **1-2 lines maximum** (no paragraph bullets)
- ✅ Start with **strong action verb** (Led, Developed, Implemented, Managed, Drove)
- ✅ Include **quantified results** (numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, scale)
- ✅ Focus on **achievements**, NOT responsibilities
- ✅ Use **present tense** for current job, **past tense** for previous jobs

**Formula:** [Action Verb] + [What] + [How/Impact with Metric]

**Examples:**
- ❌ BAD: "Responsible for managing team and projects"
- ✅ GOOD: "Led team of 8 developers to deliver 5 projects 20% under budget, improving client satisfaction by 35%"

- ❌ BAD: "Worked on improving system performance"
- ✅ GOOD: "Optimized database queries reducing API response time by 60% and supporting 10,000+ concurrent users"

## ATS Optimization (ALL RESUMES)

### File Format
- ✅ **Preferred:** .docx (Microsoft Word) - most ATS-friendly
- ✅ **Acceptable:** .pdf (if job posting allows)
- ❌ **Avoid:** .pages, .txt, Google Docs link

### Formatting for ATS
- ✅ Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, Times New Roman (10-12pt)
- ✅ Standard section headers: Professional Summary, Skills, Professional Experience, Education
- ✅ Simple bullet points (•, -, or no symbol)
- ✅ Clear hierarchy (# for name, ## for sections, ### for job titles)
- ❌ NO tables, text boxes, columns, headers/footers (except page 2 header)
- ❌ NO images, logos, graphics, icons
- ❌ NO fancy fonts or colors

### Keyword Strategy
- **1-page:** Include 15-20 relevant keywords from job description
- **2-page:** Include 25-35 relevant keywords (more space = more keywords = better ATS match)
- Place keywords naturally in Professional Summary, Skills, and bullet points
- Use industry-specific terminology
- Mirror exact phrases from job posting when possible

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### All Resumes
❌ Decorative dividers (`---`, `===`)
❌ Emojis or special characters
❌ Blank lines between bullets
❌ Listing generic skills without context
❌ Using "Responsible for" instead of action verbs
❌ Including irrelevant work experience
❌ Exceeding target word count
❌ Typos or grammar errors

### 2-Page Resumes Specifically
❌ Creating 1.5-page resume (fill both or use 1)
❌ Splitting job description between pages
❌ Putting less important content on page 1
❌ Forgetting page 2 header
❌ Unbalanced white space between pages
❌ Including 10+ jobs (focus on most recent/relevant)

## Cover Letter Guidelines (2026)

### Length Requirements (STRICT)
- **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM:** 200 words total body content
- **Target Range:** 180-200 words (4 paragraphs)
- **NEVER EXCEED 200 words** - will overflow to page 2
- **Structure:** Opening (35-40 words) + Body 1 (50-60 words) + Body 2 (50-60 words) + Closing (30-35 words)

### Why 180-200 Words?
Business letter formatting includes:
- Header: "# Cover Letter"
- Company name and address
- Salutation, closing, signature
- Contact information
**Total overhead:** ~40-50 words
**Safe body content:** 180-200 words to ensure single-page fit

### Content Requirements
1. **Opening:** State position and key qualifications (2 sentences, 35-40 words)
2. **Body Paragraph 1:** Highlight primary qualification with metrics (2-3 sentences, 50-60 words)
3. **Body Paragraph 2:** Highlight secondary qualification with metrics (2-3 sentences, 50-60 words)
4. **Closing:** Express interest and thanks (1-2 sentences, 30-35 words)

### Word Reduction Techniques
**Cut these filler phrases:**
- ❌ "I am writing to express my interest in" → ✅ "I'm interested in" (saves 6 words)
- ❌ "I have been responsible for" → ✅ "I managed" or "I administered" (saves 3 words)
- ❌ "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover," → ✅ Delete entirely (saves 1-2 words each)
- ❌ "in my current position" → ✅ "Currently" or "At [Company]" (saves 2 words)
- ❌ "while ensuring" → ✅ "ensuring" (saves 1 word)
- ❌ "I am particularly attracted to" → ✅ "I'm drawn to" (saves 3 words)

**Active voice shortcuts:**
- ❌ "I have supported" → ✅ "I supported"
- ❌ "I have assisted with" → ✅ "I assisted with"
- ❌ "positions me to contribute" → ✅ "enables me to contribute"

### Professional Style Adaptation
While resumes may use formal passive voice, cover letters MUST be concise:
- ✅ Use "I managed" not "I was responsible for managing"
- ✅ Use "I'm" and "I'd" to save words (still professional in 2026)
- ✅ Keep sentences under 20 words each
- ✅ Use periods instead of clauses with "while" or "and"
- ✅ Delete ALL transitional phrases

### Validation Checklist
Before finalizing:
- [ ] Word count is 180-200 words (body content only)
- [ ] Opening: 35-40 words
- [ ] Body 1: 50-60 words
- [ ] Body 2: 50-60 words
- [ ] Closing: 30-35 words
- [ ] No "Additionally" or "Furthermore"
- [ ] No passive voice ("I have been responsible for")
- [ ] All sentences under 20 words
- [ ] Contact info matches resume

**If word count exceeds 200, CUT content immediately.**
